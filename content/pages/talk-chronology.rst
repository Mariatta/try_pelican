Timeline of all the talks I've given, all around the world üåé.

Upcoming conferences
====================

- `PyCon Canada`_, November 18-19, 2017 in Montr√©al 2017. I'm one of the keynote
  speakers! üò±  I'm just a newbie compared to the other world renowned keynote
  speakers üò≥

Upcoming meetups / talks
========================

- Hour of Code, December 7, 2017. I will give a talk to the high school students
  of New Westminster Secondary School. I haven't prepared anything yet, but it's
  part of the *Meet a Computer Scientist* segment. I'm planning to talk about
  my career so far, what lead me to study computer science, and try to inspire
  the students to study programming. üòÜ


Past conferences
================

- `PyCon Australia 2017`_, August 5, 2017 in Melbourne. I gave a literal PEP talk!
  PEP 498: the Monologue. It was great! I'm looking for opportunities to give
  this talk again! üòù

- `PyCon US 2017`_, May 19, 2017 in Portland. The grand finale of my talk, Dial
  M For Mentor. It is reviewed as one of `10 top talks`_ of PyCon US 2017 by Brett
  Slatkin for Talk Python podcast. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks!
  After giving it at PyCon, I'm just no longer mentally or
  emotionally able to deliver this talk ever again. üòî

- PyCon Italy 2017, April 7, 2017 in Florence. I gave the talk Dial M For Mentor.

- `DjangoCon Europe 2017`_, April 5, 2017 in Florence. The European premi√®re of
  Dial M For Mentor.

- PyCaribbean 2017, February 18, 2017 in Puerto Rico. First time giving Dial
  M For Mentor at an actual conference.

- `DjangoCon US 2016`_, July 19, 2016 in Philadelphia. My first ever real
  conference talk! üò± I think it went well. It gave me confidence to try
  and continue giving talks and be better.
